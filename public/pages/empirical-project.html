			<h1>Physics Empirical Investigation Project</h1>
			<p>This will be the location for my Physics Empirical Investigation Project. The general concept will be investigating baseball players, and how much torque/force they put on the baseball when they swing the bat. This will be explored by looking at exit velocities vs. pitch velocities, and how the amount of force can change the exit velocity.</p>
