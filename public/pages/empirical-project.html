			<p><b>How does the elevation of a Major League Baseball stadium affect the air resistance on the baseball?</b></p>
			<p>There are 30 stadiums in Major League Baseball, each with slightly different environments. It's pretty common knowledge that the ball flies farther in Colorado, since Coors Field is almost a mile above sea level. As a Mariners fan, I also know that the ball tends to lose height quickly near the wall, resulting in many balls that looked like home runs landing in an outfielders glove. While elevation is likely to be a factor here, there are other environmental effects to consider, such as temperature and relative location to water.</p>
