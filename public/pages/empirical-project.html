			<h2 id='research-question'>Refined Research Question</h2>
			<p><b>How does the elevation of a Major League Baseball stadium affect the air resistance on the baseball?</b></p>
			<p>There are 30 stadiums in Major League Baseball, each with slightly different environments. It's pretty common knowledge that the ball flies farther in Colorado, since Coors Field is almost a mile above sea level. As a Mariners fan, I also know that the ball tends to lose height quickly near the wall, resulting in many balls that looked like home runs landing in an outfielders glove. While elevation is likely to be a factor here, there are other environmental effects to consider, such as temperature and relative location to water.</p>
			<h2 id='empirical-data'>Empirical Data</h2>
			<p>The site that I'll be pulling most data from is <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">Baseball Savant</a>, which is an absolutely fantastic website that includes endless statistics about baseball. In 2015, Major League Baseball introduced StatCast, which was a new way to measure previously unknown stats, such as launch angle, exit velocity, and even better projected home run distances. Baseball Savant is the way to access this data. Anyone can easily look up many advanced statistics, such as average batted ball exit velocity for hitters, and whiff (swing and miss) percentage for pitchers. On Baseball Savant, there is a page titled "Park Factors", which compares the 30 stadiums with varying metrics. You can sort the parks by "Variable Extra Distance", or in other words, roughly how much farther the ball travels by number of feet. Here is the table. Most data is copied from Baseball Savant, but I also got the average yearly humidity for each city the teams play in.</p>

			<p>So at first glance, one can see that elevation isn't the sole factor in determining how far balls will fly. While the top two parks in elevation are also the top two parks in feet added, number 3 in elevation is way down at 8 for feet added. There's also a clear outlier with Tropicana Field at 4 despite being only 15 feet above sea level, but that is because it has a fixed roof. At first glance, we might think that this answers our question, that elevation <i>sometimes</i> affects the air resistance. Or maybe just that there are other factors affecting air resistance, besides just the elevation. To better answer this question, let's look a little more into the data on the other environmental effects.</p>
		<h2 id="equations">Equations and Graphs</h2>
		<p>Let's look at some equations. Air resistance is also known as "drag force", measured in Newtons. The equation to find the force of air resistance, is one half the density (of the air) times the velocity of the object squared, times the drag coefficient times the cross-sectional area. </p>
		<span class="math inline">\(F_D=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D A\)</span>
		<p>So this makes it quite clear that air resistance is what affects the flight of the baseball, and the air resistance is affected by the air density, which varies depending on multiple conditions. One of those is humidity, which is affected based on proximity to water. Humidity was featured in the table above, but here is a feet added vs humidity graph to better illustrate the difference.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/humidity-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>Based on this graph, there is very little relation of humidity and extra feet traveled. It goes back and forth a lot, and the only obvious consistency is that the top two parks are the same on both lists.</p>
		<p>Okay, so humidity is not something that hugely impacts the drag on a baseball. How about elevation? We know that atmospheric pressure decreases with elevation, thereby decreasing air density.</p>
		<span class="math inline">\(p=p_0*(1-\frac{L*h}{T_0})^{\frac{g*M}{R_0*L}}\)</span>
		<p>This equation has a lot of constants; <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> represents the height above Earth's surface; <span class="math inline">\(p_0\)</span> represents the sea level standard atmospheric pressure; <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> represents the temperature lapse rate for dry air; <span class="math inline">\(c_p\)</span> represents the constant-pressure specific heat; <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> represents the Earth's gravitational constant; <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> represents the molar mass of dry air; and <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> represents the universal gas constant. All of these represent unchanged constants, with the <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> being whatever number we plug in. Here's a graph comparing elevation to the feet added.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/elevation-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>Wait, this isn't very helpful either. Again, the two parks Chase Field and Coors Field are standouts, but the rest don't follow a clear trend. Just like the previous graph, the numbers go up and down. Let's look at one last graph, one that compares temperature vs the extra feet traveled.</p>
		<img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../images/temperature-vs-feet.png" alt="humidty-vs-feet.png">
		<p>This is perhaps the only graph where there's some sort of correlation. Most of the parks that have the ball travel less far than average are on the lower end of the temperature, and the higher temperature ones generally have the ball travel farther. While it's not a perfectly linear graph, that at least is clear. It's also worth mentioning that the two outliers on the left half of the graph are Tropicana Field, which has a fixed roof, and Globe Life Field, which has its retractable roof closed most of the time. To be clear, the roof in Globe Life Field (and every other retractable roof stadium except for T-Mobile Park) results in a completely enclosed park, so the climate can be controlled.</p>
