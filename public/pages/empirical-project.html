			<p><b>How does the elevation of a Major League Baseball stadium affect the air resistance on the baseball?</b></p>
			<p>There are 30 stadiums in Major League Baseball, each with slightly different environments. It's pretty common knowledge that the ball flies farther in Colorado, since Coors Field is almost a mile above sea level. As a Mariners fan, I also know that the ball tends to lose height quickly near the wall, resulting in many balls that looked like home runs landing in an outfielders glove. While elevation is likely to be a factor here, there are other environmental effects to consider, such as temperature and relative location to water.</p>
			<h2 id='empirical-data'>Empirical Data</h2>
			<p>The site that I'll be pulling most data from is <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">Baseball Savant</a>, which is an absolutely fantastic website that includes endless statistics about baseball. In 2015, Major League Baseball introduced StatCast, which was a new way to measure previously unknown stats, such as launch angle, exit velocity, and even better projected home run distances. Baseball Savant is the way to access this data. Anyone can easily look up many advanced statistics, such as average batted ball exit velocity for hitters, and whiff (swing and miss) percentage for pitchers. On Baseball Savant, there is a page titled "Park Factors", which compares the 30 stadiums with varying metrics. You can sort the parks by "Variable Extar Distance", or in other words, roughly how much farther the ball travels by number of feet. Here is the table, copied from Baseball Savant:</p>

			<p>So at first glance, one can see that elevation isn't the sole factor in determining how far balls will fly. While the top two parks in elevation are also the top two parks in feet added, number 3 in elevation is way down at 8 for feet added. There's also a clear outlier with Tropicana Field at 4 despite being only 15 feet above sea level, but that is because it has a fixed roof. At first glance, we might think that this answers our question, that elevation <i>sometimes</i> affects the air resistance. Or maybe just that there are other factors affecting air resistance, besides just the elevation. To better answer this question, let's look a little more into the data on the other environmental effects.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Equations</h2>
		<p>But first, let's look at some equations. Air resistance is also known as "drag force", measured in Newtons. The equation to find the force of air resistance, is one half the density (of the air) times the velocity of the object squared, times the drag coefficient times the cross-sectional area. </p>
		<span class="math inline">\(F_D=\frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 C_D A\)</span>
		<p>So this makes it quite clear that air resistance is what affects the flight of the baseball, and the air resistance is affected by the air density, which varies depending on multiple conditions. One of those is humidity, which is affected based on proximity to water. </p>
