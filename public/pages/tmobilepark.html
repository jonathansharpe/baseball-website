			<h1 class="p-2">T-Mobile Park Overview</h1>
			<p class="p-2">T-Mobile Park is the home park of my Seattle Mariners. I grew up going to games here, and have gone to almost 60 games over the past ten seasons. This has been home to many memorable experiences, including historic games and other exciting moments. While I won't be going over every game I've attended, as I already have the game notes for that, I'll expand upon certain aspects of the park that I haven't dug into yet. When I enter T-Mobile Park, there's always a level of excitement I experience, knowing that I'm going to have a good time.</p>
			<p class="p-2">There are four main gates; left field, center field, right field, and home plate. There is also the third base entry, but that is currently only available for T-Mobile customers, a change made when T-Mobile purchased the naming rights to the stadium after Safeco Insurance decided to not renew the naming rights contract. It had previously been known as Safeco Field, which I still call it from time to time, due to calling it that all my life, and it's simply a better name in my opinion. While the home plate gate has the fancy bat sculpture chandelier, I always enter the center field gate. The stairway is enormous, and it's right across the street from my regular parking spot, the Lumen Field Event Center Parking Garage. Once you enter from this gate and ascend the stairway, you are on the concourse, and have a great view of the field. Somewhat nearby to the left is the Dave Niehaus statue, honoring the Mariners Hall of Fame broadcaster, often being the sole reason to tune into games in the early days of the franchise. </p>
