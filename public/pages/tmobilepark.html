			<h1 class="p-2">T-Mobile Park Overview</h1>
			<p class="p-2">T-Mobile Park is the home park of my Seattle Mariners. I grew up going to games here, and have gone to almost 60 games over the past ten seasons. This has been home to many memorable experiences, including historic games and other exciting moments. While I won't be going over every game I've attended, as I already have the game notes for that, I'll expand upon certain aspects of the park that I haven't dug into yet.</p>
			<h2 class="p-2">Exterior</h2>
			<p class="p-2">There are four main gates; left field, center field, right field, and home plate. There is also the third base entry, but that is currently only available for T-Mobile customers, a change made when T-Mobile purchased the naming rights to the stadium after Safeco Insurance decided to not renew the naming rights contract. It had previously been known as Safeco Field, which I still call it occasionally for obvious reasons. While the home plate gate has the fancy bat sculpture chandelier, I always enter the center field gate. The stairway is enormous, and it's right across the street from my regular parking spot, the Lumen Field Event Center Parking Garage.  </p>
			<h2 class="p-2">Concourses</h2>
			<p class="p-2">Once you enter from this gate and ascend the stairway, you are on the concourse, and have a great view of the field. Somewhat nearby to the left is the Dave Niehaus statue, honoring the Mariners Hall of Fame broadcaster, often being the sole reason to tune into games in the early days of the franchise. To the right is the concourse above the bullpen, commonly known as the 'Pen. The bleachers are beyond the left and center field walls, and have some nice padded backrests. While the center field bleachers are directly in front of the scoreboard, the left field ones still give a decent view of said scoreboard. However, you're missing out on the out-of-town scoreboard sitting up there. The center field scoreboard was the biggest scoreboard in baseball upon its installation before the 2013 season, but that has been surpassed many times over by now. </p>
			<p class="p-2">The concourse in foul territory is triple-decked, as most modern stadiums are. The main concourse is usually very busy, especially with the concessions stands separate from the main ones. The 3rd level is less busy, and is easier to navigate around. The 2nd level is definitely the nicest of the 3, as the seats have padded backrests, and the concourse is indoors. I've sat in all 3 a significant amount. While the 2nd level has nicer amenities, my favorite view and environment is on the 3rd base side. You get some great views, a perfect blend of both the field and city.</p>
			<p class="p-2">The first level has the most attractions. Aside from the locations mentioned previously, there is also the Mariners Team Store. While it also serves as an entry into the park, it's more for shopping as one may expect. There's a large number of jerseys for sale, along with a large wall of baseball hats with many recolorings of the standard Mariners logo. There are a wide variety of food options as well. There is your typical ballpark food, including hot dogs, garlic fries, beer, and more. However, there are also more unconventional choices, such as Din Tai Fung, among others. I generally just get the classic hot dog, while occasionally going for chicken tenders and fries. T-Mobile Park has Pepsi products, which might be a disappointment to some (myself included), but a nice surprise to others. There is also the kids area, which I think is known as the Moose Den, in center field. There is also a neat fountain nearby, which has 3 streams of water shooting upward, with a batter statue positioned to hit them. Also on the main level is the Mariners Hall of Fame, which includes the best players from the teams history and history of baseball in the pacific northwest. It's a neat little area and I'd recommend everyone visit it at least once.</p>
			<p class="p-2">On the 3rd level, there are some great views of the city. A good one is just above the home plate gate on the concourse, as you can get some good picturesque views of Seattle. However, there's a place at the very end of the 3rd deck on the left field side called the Trident Deck, previously known as the Lookout Landing. Here you probably get the best view of the city, and a solid view of the field. I've never sat here before, but I did go out of my way to get a picture on Opening Day 2021. Something interesting about the 3rd deck is that the seats above right field are rarely occupied by anyone. I think the Mariners prevent people from buying tickets over there unless absolutely necessary, so they don't need staffing for the concessions over there, which makes sense. Consequently, if that section is full you can bet the rest of the stadium is too. </p>
			<p class="p-2">Now for the 2nd level. I've sat here a number of times, and it's a great place to sit. It has a nicer feel compared to the rest of the park, since the sections are indoors. The seats are padded, giving a higher-class feel to the sections. The walkways are much smaller than the main concourses on the first and third decks, and as a result have fewer concession vendors. However, I've never really felt like I've missed out on what I wanted to get. As I've said, the first deck still has the most options by far. The press box is also on this level, and one time I'm pretty sure I saw Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto walk out of there. </p>
			<h2 class="p-2">Field</h2>
			<p class="p-2">The field dimensions of T-Mobile Park have been largely the same. The fences were pulled in before the 2013 season, but only by a little bit. It reduced the distances everywhere except for the right field foul line. There is an odd divot in the right field corner, where the fence is at an angle not directed to the foul pole, resulting in an odd imperfection in the field shape. While imperfections are usually a neat quirk, I kinda hope the Mariners just fill that area in with a few more seats and make it a nicer looking corner. A minor detail for sure, but it'd be a neat change. The backstop was padded for a long time, but upon the name change, the Mariners decided to change it to a brick backstop, which looks really nice in my opinion. It also results in balls bouncing back much more quickly than before. I do wish they had extended the brick wall down to the foul lines, to maintain consistency, but it doesn't look weird at all the way it is now.</p>
			<h2 class="p-2">Game Experience</h2>
			<p class="p-2">The game experience is pretty great. The scoreboard always has fun attractions. The most notable includes the hydro boat race, where 3 animated boats race on Lake Washington. The winner means absolutely nothing, but it's funny seeing people getting so passionate about a meaningless boat race during a commercial break, myself included. There is also the hat trick, where a baseball is placed under a hat, and the hats are shuffled quickly so it's hard to see where the ball is. I've seen these in other stadiums, so this one seems rather common. There's also a "guess the song" challenge done by the local classic rock radio station, along with some baseball trivia based on the year the song was from. The Mariners also play "Louie Louie" in the 7th inning stretch after Take Me Out to the Ballgame. The scoreboard will also encourage fans to get loud at certain times, which is fine I guess, but I think I prefer the more natural excitement from fans just paying attention to the situation. One thing I dislike about T-Mobile Park's scoreboard and audio is that the organ sounds really fake, and honestly it probably is. Fortunately, it's not relied on too heavily, as the sound person does a great job of playing songs that get you excited for the game. Speaking of songs, the Mariners will play a song from their TV intro from the 90s. It's also played on the radio, but it's honestly a fantastic song, and has no right to be as good as it is. </p>
