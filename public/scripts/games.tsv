07	04	2012	SEA	2	BAL	4	T-Mobile Park	Not much worth noting. Mariners offense was bad, Hector Noesi wasn't great either. Sat in the right field seats.
08	15	2012	SEA	1	TBA	0	T-Mobile Park	PERFECT GAME! First for the Mariners, twenty-third in history, and currently the most recent. Sat in the upper deck on the first base side.
09	01	2012	SEA	2	ANA	5	T-Mobile Park	Eric Wedge left Felix in too long. Otherwise nothing much. Sat in Kings Court.

08	29	2014	SEA	3	WAS	8	T-Mobile Park	Good pitching matchup, went the opposite way I expected. Postgame fireworks show. Sat in the upper deck behind home plate.
09	21	2014	CHN	5	LAN	8	Wrigley Field	First game outside of Safeco. Dodgers had a bullpen game. Last year before Cubs were good again. Last year before Wrigley added giant electronic scoreboards. Sat in the main level.
09	26	2014	CHA	3	KCA	6	Guaranteed Rate Field	Second game outisde of Safeco, third park. Named "U.S. Cellular Field" when we went. Royals were in wild card chase. Sat in the main level.
04	06	2015	SEA	4	ANA	1	T-Mobile Park	Second home opener, first Opening Day. Only game Mariners were above .500 all year. This was supposed to be "the year". Sat in the left field bleachers.
07	11	2015	SEA	5	ANA	0	T-Mobile Park	The Angels loaded the bases in the first with two outs, and Nelson Cruz made a diving catch to end the inning. Sat in the upper deck behind home plate.
07	27	2015	SEA	3	ARI	4	T-Mobile Park	First game I went to with just friends; Ben, Tyler F, and Tyler H. Not much to note here. Sat somewhere on the 100 level on the 1st base/right field side.
09	13	2015	SEA	2	COL	3	T-Mobile Park	Sat in suite for first time! Also first time seeing Sunday alts in person. Suite was on the third base side.
04	08	2016	SEA	2	OAK	3	T-Mobile Park	Third home opener. Mariners offense didn't do much. Dae-Ho Lee got first MLB hit and home run, so that was cool. Sat somewhere behind home plate, although memories of this game are rather fuzzy.
05	01	2016	SEA	1	KCA	4	T-Mobile Park	Not a great game. Mariners were going for the sweep, but their offense didn't do too well. Sat somewhere behind home plate.
06	24	2016	SEA	4	SLN	3	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with youth group. Mariners had 1-0 lead going into top of 8th, but blew it and were behind 3-1 going to the bottom of the 9th. Adam Lind hit walkoff 3-run homer to end the 6-game losing streak. Wade LeBlanc Mariner debut. Sat in the upper deck, I think behind home plate.
08	02	2016	SEA	5	BOS	4	T-Mobile Park	Mariners down 4-0 going to bottom 8, but then came back with 5 runs to take the lead and eventually win. Guilermo Heredia got first hit and first RBI, Cano hit go-ahead 3-run homer that landed close to where we sat. Edwin Diaz first career save. Sat in the right field seats.
08	06	2016	SEA	8	ANA	6	T-Mobile Park	Ken Griffey Jr. number retirement ceremony. Mike Trout 3-run homer in first. Mariners down 6-2 after four innings. Guillermo Heredia first MLB home run. Shawn O'Malley go-ahead 3-run homer in 7th inning. Sat in the upper deck along the third base side.
08	14	2016	MIN	4	KCA	11	Target Field	Third game outside of Safeco and fourth stadium. Paulo Orlando finished a double away from the cycle. Target Field was excellent. Got Matt Strahm's autograph. Sat in the main level along the third base side.
08	19	2016	KCA	5	MIN	4	Kauffman Stadium	Fourth game outside of Safeco and fifth stadium. Rain delay in fifth led to us leaving early with flight early next morning. Big thunderstorm delayed game for about three hours, and then a light delay happened as well. Royals walked it off in 11th inning at 2:15 local time. Sat on the main level on the third base side.
08	23	2016	SEA	1	NYA	5	T-Mobile Park	First game seeing Yankees. Mariners offense didn't do much. Sat possibly the closest of any game I’ve been to, behind home plate.
09	17	2016	SEA	1	HOU	2	T-Mobile Park	Mariners didn't do much on offense yet again. Important game at this point. Sat in terrace club for first time. Sat on the third base side.
04	10	2017	SEA	6	HOU	0	T-Mobile Park	Fourth home opener. James Paxton pitched a gem. Mitch Haniger continued his hot hitting. Jean Segura got injured for the first of two times. Sat in terrace club, along third base side. 
04	19	2017	SEA	10	MIA	4	T-Mobile Park	First game seeing Felix pitch since Opening Day 2015. Had a rough first inning, but settled in and did ok. Giancarlo Stanton hit an absolute bomb to left center that I missed. Ichiro hit homerun in 9th inning. Sat in upper deck behind home plate.
06	20	2017	SEA	5	DET	4	T-Mobile Park	Went with youth group. Mariners leading 4-2 going into 8th, then Dan Altavilla gave up game-tying home run to J.D. Martinez. Kyle Seager hit a double down the right field line to win the game. Sat in the upper deck along the third base side.
07	07	2017	SEA	7	OAK	2	T-Mobile Park	Mariners Snow Globe Night. Nelson Cruz 300th career home run. James Paxton pitched well again. Sat in the 100 level along the third base side, which I think I’ve concluded is the best place to sit at a Mariners game.
08	12	2017	SEA	3	ANA	6	T-Mobile Park	Edgar Martinez number retirement ceremony. Mariners had lead going into 7th, but gave it up. Went on to get swept in the four game series by the Angels, which is inexcusable if you ask me. Sat in the terrace club all the way on the right field side, so half of the scoreboard was obstructed from view.
09	22	2017	SEA	3	CLE	1	T-Mobile Park	Fan Appreciation Night, was sick and missed school yet still went to the game. Indians had won 27 of 28 coming into this game. Erasmo Ramirez pitched 8 innings, first time for the Mariners since July 3rd. Nelson Cruz walkoff 2-run home run in bottom of 9th off of Cody Allen. Sat in the 100 level along the 1st base/right field side.
03	29	2018	SEA	2	CLE	1	T-Mobile Park	Opening Day! 5th straight home opener, 2nd ever Opening Day. 2-run home run by Nelson Cruz in 1st, pitching(!) did the rest. Diaz had a little bit of a shaky 9th, but was fine and saved the game without giving up a run. Sat along the first base side, farther down the foul line.
06	11	2018	SEA	5	ANA	3	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with dad, Tyler Houtsma and Tyler Fransson. Nelson Cruz hit 2 homers, but so did Mike Trout. This win put the Mariners a half game up of the Astros in the AL West. Good game all around. Sat on the first base side a certain number of rows behind the Mariners dugout.
06	29	2018	SEA	4	KCA	1	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with friends! 3rd year in a row. Sat in section 319. Mitch Haniger and Mike Zunino each hit home runs, with Zunino's being an absolute mammoth shot, about 3 rows from the top row in the upper deck in left. Marco Gonzales threw an absolute gem, and was a strike away from a shutout after going 1-2 to Mike Moustakas before giving up an RBI single. He got the next hitter out and finished the game for his first MLB complete game. All around great game. Sat in the upper deck along the first base side.
08	17	2018	SEA	1	LAN	11	T-Mobile Park	Birthday gift from dad. Manny Machado hit two home runs. Mariners were down 1-0 and had bases loaded in the 3rd with 1 out, but failed to score. Only run was off a Ryon Healy home run. Left right before the 7th inning stretch. Andrew Romine, a position player, pitched for the Mariners. Sat in the right field seats. 
03	28	2019	SEA	12	BOS	4	T-Mobile Park	6th straight home opener. Mariners broke out the bats! Chris Sale's velocity was down after a little bit, only pitched 3 innings. Tim Beckham hit 2 HRs; Edwin Encarnacion, Domingo Santana, Ryon Healy also went deep. Very exciting game. Sat in the right field seats.
07	05	2019	SEA	2	OAK	5	T-Mobile Park	Another Friday game right before the All Star break, almost exactly 2 years to the day to the one in 2017 (also against the A's). Nothing super interesting in this one, except that Austin Nola pinch hit, and made his first professional appearance in left field! So that's cool I guess. Sat on the 100 level along the left field line.
07	17	2019	BOS	5	TOR	4	Fenway Park	6th park. First time seeing Blue Jays in person. 4th team I've seen home and away (Cubs, Royals, Twins). Fenway Park was amazing! Currently ranked #1 among stadiums, above Target Field. There was a serious chance that the game would be postponed, as thunderstorms were rampant before the game. The start time was delayed from 7:10 to around 7:45, but the whole game was played with no more delays. There was some rain during the game, but it wasn't bad. Sat in “Loge Box 118”, which is essentially a regular section cut in half so there are only 4 seats in the row. You don’t have to climb over as many people to get to your seat, and is a very easy in and out. Don’t know how many other teams have this but I will definitely be on the lookout for future stadiums, and hopefully the Mariners add this someday.
07	20	2019	NYA	11	COL	5	Yankee Stadium II	7th park. 2nd time seeing both Rockies and Yankees. 5th team I've seen home and away (Royals, Cubs, Twins, Red Sox). Yankee Stadium II was very generic and uninteresting. Local fans we talked to seem to agree that Fenway Park is superior and the new Yankee Stadium is not as good as the old one, even though the old one wasn't original from 1976-2008. We sat in our seats for about 2 innings, then got up and walked around because it was 97 degrees and the heat was near unbearable. Sat in the right-center field bleachers, but as mentioned for only about 2 innings.
07	26	2019	SEA	3	DET	2	T-Mobile Park	4th game with youth group friends, 2nd time seeing Tigers. Mariners showed no life until B7, when Tom Murphy hit game-tying 2 run homer. JP Crawford made AMAZING play for third out of top 9. Ryan Court made MLB debut and lined out on a well struck, 107 MPH, 74% hit probability line drive. Mallex Smith followed with a base hit to win the game. Hall of Fame-themed fireworks show, was amazing. Sat in the LF bleachers (now with backrests!) but moved down to the right field seats for the last couple innings.
09	29	2019	SEA	3	OAK	1	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with Andrew and Rob, first time driving from SPU to game. Only 15 mins! First time seeing last game of season, stuck around after for extra giveaways, but didn't get any. Kyle Lewis was taking pictures with fans, and I probably would have gotten one if he had stuck around a few more minutes. Kyle Seager homered, Kyle Lewis got an RBI. Pretty good way to end the season. This ended up being the last game I went to for 550 days, because of the COVID-19 pandemic that resulted in no attendance for the entirety of the 2020 MLB season, except for the NLCS and WS in Arlington, TX. Sat along the right field line in the 100 level.
04	01	2021	SEA	8	SFN	7	T-Mobile Park	7th home opener in 8 years, interrupted only by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Went with dad and Andrew, who came with me to the last Mariners game in 2019, which was also the last time fans were allowed inside T-Mobile Park. Since that game in 2019 was the day before college classes started, this was the first game I attended while in college! Capacity is limited to 9000 fans for the first two homestands, and this one is reported as a sellout. Masks and social distancing will be a thing. Postgame: Mariners were down early, 5-1 after 7 innings. They came back with 6 runs in the bottom of the 8th to take a 7-6 lead, but the Giants came back with a home run by Alex Dickerson in the top of the 9th. Mariners walked it off in the 10th off of 3 straight walks by Jose Alvarez, and due to the runner on 2nd that’s all they needed. Was very influenced by both the three batter minimum rule and the runner on 2nd in extras rule. Crowd was great despite capacity limitations, and since everyone was spread out it was plenty loud. Sat very similar to the location as the 2017 Edgar number retirement game, as half of the scoreboard was cut off in the terrace club.
04	18	2021	SEA	7	HOU	2	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with Andrew, now our 3rd game at T-Mobile Park. Mariners had won 1 of the 2 games in the series to this point, and were off to a 10-5 start. Jake Odorizzi had a rough first inning, throwing almost 40 pitches, though only allowed 1 run in that inning. Nick Margevicius pitched well, though had to leave due to arm fatigue in the 5th inning. The bullpen really picked him up, allowing no hits the rest of the game, and Marge only allowed one, resulting in a combined one-hitter! The Mariners broke out the bats in the bottom of the 5th, scoring 4 runs and taking a lead they wouldn’t give back. This was also the largest win margin to this point in the season, at 5 runs, and therefore their first “blowout” win by Baseball-Reference’s standards. The weather was super nice, an impossible mid-70s day in April. As a result Andrew and I both got sunburned on our arms. The boos were also VERY loud, since this was the first series the Astros played in Seattle with fans after the 2017 cheating scandal came to light in late 2019/early 2020. Since we sat in the left field bleachers, there was also a lot of heckling aimed at the Astros left fielder, Chas McCormick, despite the fact that he made his MLB debut in 2021 and had nothing to do with the scandal. There was a legendary group of hecklers behind us that were going at it most of the game, and was by far the most heckling I’d ever heard. Overall fantastic experience, though sunscreen is a must for future day Mariners games. Sat in the LF bleachers, section 183, right in the sun.
04	30	2021	SEA	7	ANA	4	T-Mobile Park	Went to game with Andrew, our 4th game. Since Andrew is an Angels fan, we were rooting for opposing teams for the 2nd time already. Sat in section 147 row 22 seats 12 and 13. Chris Flexen had a tough outing, but managed to make it through 4 innings giving up only 3 runs. Ohtani hit a home run but I missed it because I was looking at my phone at that time D: . For the first inning, I predicted that Trout and Haniger would both homer, Haniger more specifically on the first pitch. He did in fact hit a leadoff home run, first of the year, but it was not off the first pitch. Fortunately Trout did not homer in the first. It was a beautiful night for baseball, if a bit cold later on. There was an annoying heckler who was yelling stuff off and on. With it being April 30th, in the middle of the 8th inning, they played the song “It’s Gonna Be Me”, but the “me” sounds like “May” so that’s the text that was on the electronic scoreboards. However, they played it after the Mariners hitters got on base, scored a couple runs, AND during the pitching change, and it was hilarious. Mariners bullpen came in clutch once again, as the Angels ceased to score after the 3rd until the 9th inning, where they just got 1 off of Rafael Montero. Struggling hitters Dylan Moore and Tom Murphy both homered and got other RBI hits, which was big for both of them. Overall great game to go to, especially since the Mariners lost big, 10-5 the next night. Andrew wasn’t super jazzed about it, but we still had a fun time.
08	04	2021	LAN	7	HOU	5	Dodger Stadium	This will be park #8, and only 2nd in the National League. This game is going to be ELECTRIC, because the cheating Astros are facing the Dodgers with Max Scherzer making his Dodgers debut. Will be my first time seeing Scherzer in person, but funnily enough I saw Odorizzi earlier in the year against the Mariners. We’re sitting in the “field level”, and I don’t know where it is but it sounds close! Game starts at 6:40 PM. POSTGAME: the crowd was indeed electric. By far the best crowd I'd been a part of at a baseball game before. There were many chants, including "Astros Suck", "Cheaters", and "F*ck Correa". The park itself was incredible, and is so LA it's unreal. The concourses were neat, and interestingly enough the bottom ones seemed more updated than the top ones. We went to the 4th deck to get a picture, which was a very cool view. The bleacher area was also really cool, and there were plenty of places to walk around. I got autographs from Manny Mota and Steve Yeager. Yeager mentioned that he played in Seattle in his final year, and told me to enjoy my time here :D. The food selection was off the charts, and while T-Mobile Park might have more variety, all the options at Dodger Stadium made a lot of sense for baseball. There were BBQs, Dodger Dogs, garlic fries, burgers, ice cream, nachos, street tacos, and more. I went with a Dodger Dog, which were decent, but the fries were good and they had Coke products. Also got the obligatory soft serve helmet cup. Overall probably the best experience I've ever had at a baseball game. Dodger Stadium is at least a very close second to Fenway Park, if not a new #1. Cannot wait to go back.
08	06	2021	SDN	5	ARI	8	Petco Park	Park #9, 3rd in the National League. Will be the 2nd time seeing the Diamondbacks, and first of two times on the trip. The Padres have been really good this year, so the crowd should also be excellent here. Will have to check out the Western Metal Supply Co. building. Overall seems like a nice park, looking forward to this one (as I am with all of them :D). POSTGAME: This park was very nice. Dodger Stadium set the bar so high that this was almost a disappointment, but it was still excellent. They had some live music beyond the batters eye in center field, as well as a grass lawn called the “Park at the Park” which looked like a neat hangout space; it was full when we got into the park. Like Dodger Stadium, this park had the odds on one side and the evens on the other side, so our section was somewhat easier to find I guess. The number system is growing on me but still a little weird. Got ice cream here too, though I think the Dodger Stadium stuff was better. They also had Coca-Cola products, and I got another souvenir cup, and remembered it this time. As for the game itself, the Dbacks starter struggled HARD, and was walking everyone. The Padres scored 5 runs in the 2nd, but that was all they’d get for the entire game. The Padres gave it back up, and the go-ahead run was driven in by...the winning pitcher!! He also stole 2nd, which added to the weirdness. The first, and probably the last time I’ll see a relief pitcher hit the go-ahead RBI in a game. We sat in the upper deck, which by default were the worst seats we had, but they weren’t bad or anything. Overall good experience, definitely in the top-tier of parks visited.
08	08	2021	OAK	6	TEX	3	Oakland Coliseum	3rd park of the trip, and honestly not as bad as I thought it would be. There were 3 things that were not great compared to every other stadium though. The first was that they didn’t have Coca-Cola, or Pepsi, but RC COLA. Never seen any other park have this, and I don’t expect to see it ever again. Second, the bathrooms had troughs instead of urinals, which I was concerned about once I realized Wrigley, another old stadium, had them in 2014. Lastly, Andrew ordered pizza, and waited for 40 mins for them to text him it was ready. Then he went over to see what was up, and they said they didn’t have the ability to text him that it was ready, despite the app saying it would. So those three things were easily surpassed by every other stadium I’ve been to. However it was kinda cool being in a “concrete jungle” stadium. The 2nd concourse was absolutely dead, but the main concourse was poppin’. What was interesting was while they had ramps, the other way to get up was to get to the 100 level concourse, then go up to the 200 level sections. From the 200 level, you could either go back down using those same stairs, or go up the stairs to the 200 level concourse. From there you could go to the 300 level seats. So the first stadium I’d been to where you could access all the decks just by going throughout the sections. I took some pictures on the top deck, which was honestly pretty neat. There is something really satisfying about the circular nature of the stadium, despite it being outdated and surpassed. Our seats were pretty decent, though they didn’t feel as close to the 200 level seats in SF. Overall decent to good experience, and I would honestly rather go here again than Yankee Stadium.
08	10	2021	SFN	8	ARI	7	Oracle Park	Park #4 of the trip, and another park where we got free tickets! These seats were right up there with the Dodger Stadium seats in quality, and they were on the 200 level. It was a very intimate feel, which was amazing I thought. We had some fun beyond center field in a relatively new “party deck” area, and the Dbacks had batting practice. A relief pitcher, Bret de Geus was giving kids balls, and one kid gave his bracelet to him as a trade for a ball! Andrew also gave his necklace to him, which was neat. The game was pretty exciting, the Giants took what seemed like a commanding lead before Alex Wood just absolutely lost it in the 6th inning after looking nearly unhittable for the first several innings. The Giants took the lead in the 8th, before Jake McGee struggled in the 9th and walked a few guys, and the Dbacks eventually tied the game. The Giants ended up walking it off, via an error batted by Kris Bryant! Very exciting game, and the park was amazing, a close second to Dodger Stadium. Would love to return to this one as well.
08	12	2021	ANA	6	TOR	3	Angel Stadium	The final game of the trip. Angel Stadium was a very middle-middle ballpark; nothing super great, but also not bad, very much decent. I got a hat here, a California Angels one from ‘72-’92, that cost $50 because it was fitted! A nice hat though, very comfortable and looks cool. The food options were less than stellar, but they had a few good ones here and there. We unfortunately sat in front of the scoreboard in right field, so we lost out on the stuff on there, but the left field scoreboard gave most of the information that was out of our view. I went up to the 3rd deck in the later innings to get a picture from the top-most row behind home plate, and got a good picture. We got to see Shohei Ohtani, who pitched a great game and lead off the game with a double. Unfortunately that was all he did with the bat, I was hoping for a home run since we were in prime home run territory. The game was honestly probably the least interesting from a neutral fan perspective, but the Blue Jays lost, which was important for the Mariners. Overall a good end to the parks we visited.
